# python_for_beginners
Entire credit to Naveen Reddy - Telsuko Youtube channel for educating the future problem solvers.
I had created these documents from his YouTube "python for beginners" series, in case if you have any doubts or clarifications regarding the documentation either you can reach me or check out Naveen Reddy's youtube vidoes. Do support his channel.

The reason I had created these documents is I wanted to teach my cousins as they might not be able to learn on their own. By this time 2nd May 2022 One cousin is btech final year and the other is 8th standard.
yes, 8th standard and he is doing pretty well with coding. I felt that If I make these public it might someone who are good with learning using documentation rather than that of videos.

There will be spelling mistakes/formatting errors and some topics are confusing as well. However, I have other commitments in parallel so couldn't deliver my best for this documentation, forgive me for that.

can't thank enough Mr.Naveen Reddy and other educators who are serving selflessly. You guys inspire many people like me across the globe.
