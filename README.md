# python_for_beginners
Entire credit to Naveen Reddy - Telsuko Youtube channel for educating the future problem solvers.
I had created these documents from his YouTube "python for beginners" series, in case if you have any doubts or clarifications regarding the documentation either you can reach me or check out Naveen Reddy's youtube vidoes. Please do support his channel.

The reason I had created these documents is I wanted to teach my cousins as they are not in a situation to learn python programming on their own. By the time of this writing 2nd May 2022 One cousin is Batchelors of engineering final year and the younger one is 8th standard. We had sessions for more than 3 months, an hour a day on Discord. 
yes, 8th standard and he is doing pretty well with coding. I felt that If I make these public it might help the ones who are good with learning programming using documentation. I tried my best to make them beginner friendly. We were able to complete this series on 18th June.

There will be spelling mistakes/formatting errors and some topics are confusing as well. However, I have other commitments in parallel so couldn't deliver my best for this documentation, forgive me for that. Let me know if you feel there are any improvements so that I can improvise them whenever possible. Please refer to other repositories for some of the scripts that we have used while sessions.

can't thank enough Mr.Naveen Reddy and other educators who are serving selflessly. You guys inspire many people like me across the globe.
